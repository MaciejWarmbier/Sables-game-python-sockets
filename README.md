A little Python project I did during my studies. It is multiplayer game where player tries to kill each other and step into each other territory. Mechanics are pretty simple as plyers have 3 height to choose to attack from. Game uses Pyhton Pygame and Socket extensions and can be played on local network usind IPv4 protocol.Â
